## Background Assignment

Program a super simple “Hello World” smart contract: write a storeNumber function to store an unsigned integer and then a retrieveNumber function to retrieve it. Clearly comment your code. Once completed, deploy the smart contract on remix. Push the .sol file to Github or Gist and include a screenshot of the Remix UI once deployed in your final submission pdf.
